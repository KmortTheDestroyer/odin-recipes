    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Chicken tikka masala is a popular Indian dish that consists of small pieces of marinated chicken (called "tikka") that are grilled or roasted and then simmered in a creamy tomato-based sauce (called "masala"). 
        The chicken is first marinated in a mixture of yogurt and spices, including cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala, which gives it a flavorful and slightly tangy taste.
